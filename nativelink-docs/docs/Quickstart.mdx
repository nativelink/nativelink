## üì¶ Installing with Cargo

Install or Update Rust

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="install" label="Install" default>
    ```sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="update" label="Update">
    ```sh
    rustup update
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink --tag v0.3.0
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `nativelink` executable reads a JSON file as it's only parameter,
`--config`. See the [configuration docs](https://docs.nativelink.dev/Configuration)
for more details and examples.

To grab the example in your current working directory, run:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json
```

### üöÄ Start NativeLink

```sh
nativelink basic_cas.json
```

Once you've built NativeLink and have an instance running with the
`basic_cas.json` configuration, launch a separate terminal session and run the
following command to connect the running server launched above to Bazel or
another RBE client:

```sh
bazel test //... \
  --remote_instance_name=main \
  --remote_cache=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 \
  --remote_default_exec_properties=cpu_count=1
```

For Windows sh;

```sh
bazel test //... `
  --remote_instance_name=main `
  --remote_cache=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 `
  --remote_executor=grpc://127.0.0.1:50051 `
  --remote_default_exec_properties=cpu_count=1
```
This causes Bazel to run the commands through an all-in-one `CAS`, `scheduler`
and `worker`.

**üéâ Tada üéâ NativeLink is working.**

## üå± Building with Bazel

**Build requirements:**

* Bazel 7.0.2
* A recent C++ toolchain with LLD as linker

:::tip

This build supports Nix/direnv which provides Bazel but no C++ toolchain
(yet).

:::

The following commands place an executable in `./bazel-bin/nativelink` and start
the service:

```sh
# Unoptimized development build on Unix
bazel run nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Optimized release build on Unix
bazel run -c opt nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Unoptimized development build on Windows
bazel run --config=windows nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Optimized release build on Windows
bazel run --config=windows -c opt nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json
```

:::note

The `--release` flag causes link-time-optmization to be enabled, which can take a while to compile, but will result in a much faster binary.

:::

:::warning

The Rust compiler (rustc) generates numerous artifacts during compilation,
including dependencies, macros, and intermediate files.
When compiling programs from source, be mindful of the associated files'
impact on your disk usage in the bazel-bin/ directory.
This directory can grow substantially in size.

If the facing issues due to this, run the following command
to clear cache files:
```sh
bazel clean --expunge
```

:::

## üì¶ Building with Cargo

**Build requirements:**

* Cargo 1.74.0+
* A recent C++ toolchain with LLD as linker

:::tip

This build supports Nix/direnv which provides Cargo but no C++
toolchain/stdenv (yet).

:::

```sh
# Unoptimized development build
cargo run --bin nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json

# Optimized release build
cargo run --release --bin nativelink -- ./nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json
```

:::warning

The Rust compiler (rustc) generates numerous artifacts during compilation,
including dependencies, macros, and intermediate files.
When compiling programs from source, be mindful of the associated files'
impact on your disk usage in the target/ directory.
This directory can grow substantially in size.

If the facing issues due to this, run the following command
to clear cache files:
```sh
cargo clean
```

:::

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Installing with Nix

**Installation requirements:**

* Nix with [flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) enabled

This build does not require cloning the repository, but you need to provide a
config file, for instance the one at [nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json](https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/blob/main/nativelink-config/examples/basic_cas.json).

The following command builds and runs NativeLink in release (optimized) mode:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink ./basic_cas.json
```

For use in production pin the executable to a specific revision:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink/<revision> ./basic_cas.json
```

```sh
# Get the tag for the latest commit
export LATEST=$(nix eval github:TraceMachina/nativelink#image.imageTag --raw)

# Verify the signature
cosign verify ghcr.io/tracemachina/nativelink:${LATEST} \
    --certificate-identity=https://github.com/TraceMachina/nativelink/.github/workflows/image.yaml@refs/heads/main \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

For use in production pin the executable to a specific revision:

```sh
nix run github:TraceMachina/nativelink/<revision> ./basic_cas.json
```

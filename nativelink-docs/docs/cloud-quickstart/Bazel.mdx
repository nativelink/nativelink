# Bazel Remote Caching Cloud Quickstart

To connect NativeLink to your Bazel project simply add the code below to your `.bazelrc` file. If you can't find a `.bazelrc` file - create one in the same directory as your Bazel `WORKSPACE` or `MODULE.bazel` file.

:::note

Fill in the `CLAIM_URL` and `API_KEY` from the [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com)

:::

1. **Configure your `.bazelrc`**
   - Copy the following lines into your `.bazelrc`:
     ```
     build --remote_cache=[CLAIM_URL]
     build --remote_header=x-nativelink-api-key=[API_KEY]
     build --remote_timeout=600
     ```

2. **Validate Connection**
   - Once you've added those lines to your `.bazelrc`, run a Bazel build.
   - You will see remote cache utilization on the [Dashboard](https://app.nativelink.com/dashboard) page if your `.bazelrc` is configured correctly.

/// An `Action` captures all the information about an execution which is required

///
/// `Action`s are the core component of the \[Execution\] service. A single
/// `Action` represents a repeatable action that can be performed by the

/// their wire format encoding and, once an `Action` has been executed, will be
/// cached in the action cache. Future requests can then use the cached result
/// rather than needing to run afresh.

/// When a server completes execution of an

/// cache the \[result][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ActionResult\] in
/// the \[ActionCache][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.ActionCache\] unless
/// `do_not_cache` is `true`. Clients SHOULD expect the server to do so. By
/// default, future calls to
/// \[Execute][build.bazel.remote.execution.v2.Execution.Execute\] the same
/// `Action` will also serve their results from the cache. Clients must take care
